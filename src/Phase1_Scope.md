A focus on brushwork, light and color, subtle color variations. Painterly, not photo-real. 
Use up all the small blank canvases in the shop. Can be stretched, can be boards, as long
as they're within the size constraints, and you don't purchase any new art supplies. 

### Output Constraints:

### Theme Constraints:
Theme: Happy Where We Are
The photo should be of the Benson area, around home, the neighborhood, or downtown Benson. 
The photo can be of anything, but the theme of the set is 'Happy Where We Are', so photos from places we like to visit, store fronts, Maple street, Flowers and plants are fine, but in the setting.
