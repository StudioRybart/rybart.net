The game: 
Make something every week for 26 weeks, around 26 topics of your choice, each starting with a different letter of the alphabet.  While the topics change weekly, constraints set by the artist keep the rest of the work focused. 

The goal:
Outwardly, the aim is to create a cohesive body of creative work, for both you and our world.
Inwardly, the aim is to push past your mental limits that stop you from reaching your potential.

## Phase 1: Scope

### Medium Constraints:
Core Medium:  Acrylic Painting, Social media post, personal website post

### Style Constraints:
It must use photo reference taken by us.  An original photo taken by myself or my wife Cassie. 
One my goals with this project is to improve at painting from observation.
Style:  'impressionistic realism'
A focus on brushwork, light and color, creating interest with subtle color variations. Painterly, not photo-real, but but illustrative, not abstract. 
Use up all the small blank canvases in the shop. Can be stretched, can be boards, as long
as they're within the size constraints, and I don't purchase any new art supplies. 
Painted with the acrylics in my bulk box, no other colors. 
Mostly square / flat brushes. 

### Output Constraints:
Output Per Week:
1x small finished physical painting, minimum size 6"x6", maximum size 12"x12". 
minimum of 5 WIP photos + digital photo of finished painting
Finished painting along WIP shots gets it's own webpage at studio.rybart.net / alphabet.rybart.net
Finished painting get's added to gallery page at Rybart.net
semi-daily posts to twitter of WIP at 9pm.
photos will need to be cropped and uploaded, gallery card and grouping with WIP shots will be automated as part of rybar.net repo.

### Theme Constraints:
Theme: Happy In Benson
	Reasons: 
			- I'm constantly inspired by photos we take and strolling the Benson area during events and night life, thinking "That'd make a good painting" and then never making a painting. 
			- I love the textures and beauty that can be found in the mundane
			- I want to have a body of work for my first art show, which will hopefully happen somewhere here in my home neighborhood of Benson
		
The reference photo should be of the Benson area, around home, the neighborhood, or downtown Benson. 
The painting can be of anything, but the theme of the set is 'Happy In Benson', so paintings based on places we like to visit, store fronts, Maple street, etc.
Flower, plant and insect photos are fine, as long as they bring us joy and we took the photos. 
Butterfly garden pics also fit the theme.
