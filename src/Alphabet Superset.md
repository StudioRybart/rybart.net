The game: 
Make something every week for 26 weeks, around 26 topics of your choice, each starting with a different letter of the alphabet.  While the topics change weekly, constraints set by the artist keep the rest of the work focused. 

The goal:
Outwardly, the aim is to create a cohesive body of creative work, for both you and our world.
Inwardly, the aim is to push past your mental limits that stop you from reaching your potential.
